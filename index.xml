      <description>1Consequences of Blocking Synchronization:  1.1Making Channels Non-Blocking + Select   2Consequences of Consumption:  2.1Cannot be easily used as a broadcast mechanism 2.2How about the inverse case?   3Example of when we would want to Consume + Block: Streams: 4Channels Often Come with a Level of Indirection:  4.1Tee Channel 4.2Consequence of Indirection   5Final Remarks  This blog post is a summary of an investigation I did regarding channel vs mutex usage, as most resources I found would just present examples side by side without talking about the properties of mutexes/channels that made one implementation better than other(Or in other words, the why).</description>

      <description>How CRTP works CRTP is not &amp;ldquo;template programming magic&amp;rdquo; We already have static polymorphism We already have static implementation inheritance&amp;hellip;Except Appendix-Dynamic Dispatch  On my first encounter, the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern seemed like magic to me. Apparently, by writing static_cast&amp;lt;T*&amp;gt;(this)-&amp;gt;func(), we now have &amp;ldquo;static polymorphism/inheritance&amp;rdquo;. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until a few months and some c++ learning resources later, that I was finally able to understand CRTP. In this blogpost, I will talk about CRTP from more of a code generation point of view, and hopefully by then end convince you that &amp;ldquo;static polymorphism/inheritance&amp;rdquo; is a misleading description of this pattern.</description>

      <description>For now, blog will mainly be on programming language features and how they affect software design. Hoping to expand to Vim/Emacs in the future!
(P.S Also am a new grad looking for a job)
